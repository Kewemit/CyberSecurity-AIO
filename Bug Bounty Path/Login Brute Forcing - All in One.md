# Introduction
Keys and passwords, the modern equivalent of locks and combinations, secure the digital world. But what if someone tries every possible combination until they find the one that opens the door? That, in essence, is `brute forcing`.
## What exactly is Brute Forcing?
In cybersecurity, brute forcing is a **trial-and-error** method used to **crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys**. It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found. The process can be likened to a thief trying every key on a giant keyring until they find the one that unlocks the treasure chest.

**The success of a brute force attack depends on several factors, including:**
- The `complexity` of the password or key. Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are **exponentially** more complex to crack.

- The `computational power` available to the attacker. Modern computers and specialized hardware can try **billions** of combinations per second, significantly reducing the time needed for a successful attack.

- The `security measures` in place. **Account lockouts**, **CAPTCHAs**, and **other defences** can slow down or even thwart brute-force attempts.
## How Brute Forcing Works
The brute force process can be visualized as follows:

1. `Start`: The attacker initiates the brute force process.
2. `Generate Possible Combination`: The software generates a potential password or key combination based on predefined parameters, **such as character sets and length**.
3. `Apply Combination`: The generated combination is attempted against the target system, such as a **login form** or **encrypted file**.
4. `Check if Successful`: The system evaluates the attempted combination. If it matches the stored password or key, access is granted. Otherwise, the process continues.
5. `Access Granted`: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the system or data.
6. `End`: The process repeats, generating and testing new combinations until either the correct one is found or the attacker gives up.
