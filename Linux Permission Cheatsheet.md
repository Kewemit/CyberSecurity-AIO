The permissions like `-m 0755` are used to set file or directory permissions. The `0755` is a **numeric representation** of the permissions, and understanding it is important for managing file access in a secure and controlled way.
### Breakdown of the Number `0755`
The number `0755` is an **octal** (**base-8**) number, and it defines **file permissions** for three groups of users:
1. **Owner** (the file’s owner, in this case `7`)
2. **Group** (users who are members of the file’s group, in this case `5`)
3. **Others** (everyone else, in this case `5`)

Each of these groups has three permission levels:
- **Read (r)**: Permission to read the file's content.
- **Write (w)**: Permission to modify the file’s content.
- **Execute (x)**: Permission to execute the file (run it if it’s a script or binary) or access a directory.

Each permission is represented by a number:
- **Read (r)** is `4`
- **Write (w)** is `2`
- **Execute (x)** is `1`
- **No permission (no r, w, x)** is `0`

#### Understanding `0755`
`0755` is broken down into three digits (from left to right):

1. **Owner permissions (7)**:
    - The `7` means the owner can **read**, **write**, and **execute**.
    - The permission for the **owner** is: `4 (read) + 2 (write) + 1 (execute) = 7`.
2. **Group permissions (5)**:
    - The `5` means the group can **read** and **execute**, but not write.
    - The permission for the **group** is: `4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5`.
3. **Other permissions (5)**:
    - The `5` means others (everyone else) can **read** and **execute**, but not write.
    - The permission for **others** is: `4 (read) + 1 (execute) = 5`.

So, `0755` means:
- **Owner**: Read, write, and execute (`rwx`)
- **Group**: Read and execute (`r-x`)
- **Others**: Read and execute (`r-x`)

### Why the leading 0?
The leading `0` in like `0755` indicates that the number is in **octal** (base 8) format.

In Unix, file permissions are often specified using a **numeric (octal) representation**. The leading `0` is a way to explicitly indicate that the number is **octal**, rather than **decimal** (base 10).
#### Breakdown:
- **Octal representation**: The system expects file permissions to be represented in octal (base 8) format. **Octal uses digits from 0 to 7.**
- **Leading `0`**: The leading `0` in a number like `0755` signals that it’s an octal number. This helps distinguish it from a decimal number.

### Does this Need to Be Memorized?
Remembering these helps to have a good understanding of **common permission patterns**. The most common permission sets you might encounter are:
- **`0755`**: Typical for **directories** and **executable**s. The owner has full permissions (read/write/execute), while the group and others can **read** and **execute**, but not write.
- **`0644`**: Common for regular files. The owner can read and write, while the group and others can only read.
- **`0700`**: Secure, private permissions for files or directories. Only the owner has access.
- **`0777`**: Full **read**/**write**/**execute** permissions for everyone.
### Quick Reference Table

|Number|Owner|Group|Others|Description|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`0000`|---|---|---|No permissions|
|`0755`|rwx|r-x|r-x|Typical for directories/files|
|`0700`|rwx|---|---|Only owner can access (secure)|
|`0644`|rw-|r--|r--|Typical for regular files|
|`0777`|rwx|rwx|rwx|Full access for everyone (insecure)|

### How to Set Permissions Using `chmod`
To change permissions with `chmod`, you would use the `-m` option followed by the numeric value:
- **Example**: To set a file or directory to `0755` permissions:
```bash
$ sudo chmod -m 0755 somefile
```
**OR**
```bash
sudo chmod 0755 somefile
```
### Summary:
- **The numbers (0755)** represent file permissions in octal format.
- **7 = rwx**, **5 = r-x**, **4 = r--**, and so on.
- r = read | w = write | x = execute
