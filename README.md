# Penetration Testing Cheat Sheet
This Obsidian project is a collection of my detailed notes, cheat sheets, and references, all focused on penetration testing and related cybersecurity concepts. 

This list Contains my complete cheat sheet gathered from THM, HTB and various other resources

My notes were originally written in [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) where i ported them to **Obsidian**. There may be some porting errors

## Why This Repository Exists
I made this repository to document my journey and provide useful information I could come back to anytime. It's meant to:
- Serve as my knowledge base.
- Possibly help others learn and understand some concepts.
- Notes I can come back to when in need, without having to open specific sites.
